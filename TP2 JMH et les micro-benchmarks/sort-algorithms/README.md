# Sorting algorithms

This simple project contains the implementations of several sorting algorithm in Java. I'm using this project to learn new algorithms and to have fun. Moreover, I'm teaching Java to college students and I'm using those implementations to test some stuff such as micro-benchmark using JMH.
